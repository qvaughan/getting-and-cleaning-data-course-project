Feature Selection 
==================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ)

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Each value was then merged with it's corresponding activity_name and subject_id. activity_name is one of six possible values WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING. The subject_id is an integer that can be used to uniquely identify which observations belong to a given individual. 

The data set is then averaged grouping by activity_name and subject_id.

The units for the accelorometer (Acc) signals are standard gravity units 'g' while the gyroscope units (Gyro) are radians/second.
